Tears welled up in 38-year-old Manjunatha’s eyes when he dug deep into the recesses of his mind, unearthing some of the tragic memories of his family's past. We often hear of rags to riches stories but he had a riches to rags one. 

A son of a hotelier in Hyderabad, Manjunatha’s father dreamed for his success, just as all fathers do. The whole family rejoiced when Manjunatha attained a diploma in engineering from Mysore. Many congratulated the newly-made engineer as he joined LNT, a reputable IT services company, in Hyderabad. He felt honoured by the opportunity but little did he know about the storm that was brewing and how it would whirl his life into a completely different direction.  
<br><br>

As fate would have it, Manjunatha’s father’s hotel suffered heavy losses. The blow was so harsh that it knocked the entire family out of their very own house along with the status they had achieved after years of hard work.

Being the earnest son that he was, Manjunatha opted to lose everything he had strived for in Hyderabad to lend his emotional support to a family that had done the same for him ever since he was a little boy.
<br><br>

With his father’s blood pumping through his veins, Manjunatha drew up a plan, involved in the food business, to focus his energies on. It was a simple yet uplifting thought of starting a meal service. 

Initially, he had to come to terms with the fact that the house they were living in was not their own but one they had to take on rent. The skyrocketing prices were a constant headache for a man who earned less than Rs 500 per day, most of it going into paying for expenses.
<br><br>
Inflation is the antagonist of this story - luckily, he benefitted from the graciousness of social investors who, through Rang De, have lent him Rs.10 000 and helped him rebuild his life. 

He has to do without labourers but still maintains a high level of cleanliness and hygiene. He is utilising his first loan industriously as he has doubled the purchase of raw materials and increased the number of food products. He earns around Rs 1,000 for a day's work and saves 200-400 each day.

He hopes to take another loan that would help him start a mobile canteen that can cater at high courts, schools, colleges or hospitals. <br><br>
We ended up learning a lot more from him in terms of courage as he took the downturns in life as they came instead of being upset about why events did not unfold in the desired manner. It was a very interesting story because he could have easily stayed back in Hyderabad and earned a decent living, supporting his family, but he told us that he knew his family needed him as a person. 

He knew that they needed him for support more than the money he would have earned and sent. 

This man is treading on a path less taken but one he finds more rewarding.
