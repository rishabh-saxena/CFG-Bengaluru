Hospitals, ill health, medical emergencies and physical disability are words that we all dread. But to Malabai Laxman Mujmule, these aren’t just words. Her reality has always revolved around them.  
<br><br>
She was a young girl of 23 when we first met her, sitting and helping out in the grocery shop that her father ran. Her father - her role model, her friend, her teacher and ardent supporter. In the three years of our association with Malabai, we have learnt more about the special bond between this father-daughter duo.  
<br><br>
In rural India, giving birth to a girl child is considered inauspicious. A daughter paralysed from her waist down is looked down upon even more. Malabai was born a girl child and she was disabled. But not only did her father stand by her, he got her a wooden board with wheels to help her move around, and in a way, to stand on her own two feet.  
<br><br>
A few months ago, these roles were reversed when her father suffered a spinal cord injury. Despite a dearth of money, restriction in movement and lack of support, Malabai courageously took responsibility of ensuring her father’s treatment. She spent their savings as well as the loan funds, on her father’s healthcare. This dedication and love ultimately gave her father an extra month to live.

<br><br>
In the absence of her father, times of need continue and Malabai is grateful to have found a mentor in Sagras - Rang De's field partner in Digras, Maharashtra. Sagras has mentored her from the start, making sure that she makes improvements to her shop, attends meetings of the self-help group etc.  
<br><br>
Due to her disability and the lack of proper communication facilities, Malabai would often miss out on group meetings. Her disability also posed a challenge in procuring goods for her shop, which required that she travel to wholesalers located nearly 10 kms away. Sagras recommended that she purchase a mobile phone, an easy solution that could help solve both these issues.  
<br><br>
With the contact numbers of all the dealers available on her phone, all Malabai had to do now was to make a call to replenish the stock. It also enabled group members to notify her ahead of the regular meetings.  
<br><br>
Slowly but steadily, Malabai has been able to improve the financial condition of her family. Her monthly income is now around Rs 7,000, of which she is able to save half. She lives with her mother, brother and sister-in-law in a small house near the grocery shop. The mud road is filled with potholes and a gutter runs next to it. Malabai wants to save enough so that she can shift to a better and cleaner place. She also plans to expand her business and sell a wider range of items.
<br><br>
At the group, Malabai is looked up to as a source of inspiration to all, something she says her father would have been very happy to see. Her hard work and perseverance have helped her develop herself and her business, though she tells us that she still has a long way to go. 
<br><br>
Malabai’s is a story, that we at Rang De are very proud of. We believe that it is only a matter of time until she becomes self-reliant, her physical disability being more driving than disabling. </p>
