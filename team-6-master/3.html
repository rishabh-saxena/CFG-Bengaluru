Here's a story that shows how the entrepreneurial spirit lies within us. Here's a story that shows how a family's fortunes changed dramatically after a woman was given a chance at self-employment. Kasturi Verma and her family of five barely got by on a meagre monthly income of 6000/- that came from her husband’s tailoring business. Kasturi started assisting her husband in his tailoring work three years ago after getting motivated by the work of VAMA, a Rang De impact partner, and wanted to assume an active role in contributing to their family income. Once she began working, Kasturi realized her untapped zeal for entrepreneurship. She quickly devised ways of improving their family income and their living conditions improved as well. She found that stitching shirts is far more profitable than stitching raincoats like her husband had been doing for the last ten years.

After borrowing 8000/- from Rang De, she bought a sewing machine and the family began to save more as well. A second loan of Rs 12000/- was used not only to buy two more sewing machines but also to hire another tailor to support their evolving business! This made an incredible impact on their livelihood and the family income increased by four times to Rs 24000! They are now saving five times more than before. This story is not just about numbers, though. Kasturi seized the opportunity she got to make meaningful changes in her life. In empowering herself, she also empowered her family.
