What can you do if you heard of a neighbour that did not want to bring up a girl child? What can you do if a rural family that already has a number of daughters does not want to feed another mouth? 

Yasmin Bano had three sons at that time. Yasmin Bano decided she would take care of one more child. 

A girl child. 
<br><br>
A clothes seller by profession, Yasmin Bano has been bringing up this little girl even as her family struggled without a toilet all these years. 

"For the first time in my life, I am living with a toilet in my home," 37-year-old Yasmin told us when we visited her in April. 

Getting this far has been a challenge for most rural entrepreneurs but to do it in such a caring manner shows a level of humanity that we should all aspire towards. 

She doesn't speak much, the girl who calls Yasmin her 'ammi'. When she saw Rang De photographer Deepak visiting various borrowers in the village of Digras, she immediately snuck into one of the houses. 

Like any other little girl, she wanted to be part of a group picture. 

Little did Deepak know at the time that this girl had grown up amid such high drama.

Things are better now for the girl, Deepak was told, as the father has accepted her (albeit reluctantly) but she still runs to Yasmin's house whenever she can to meet the woman who showed her a mother's tenderness in the early years of her life. 

Yasmin's three sons - Sahil (14), Rahil (12) and Rehan (11) - are currently attending school. With the help of Sagras (a Rang De field partner in Maharashtra), Yasmin has even built up a well-stocked garments selling business that caters to the need of the women in her community. Before their timely intervention, Yasmin's family were not even in a position to have two meals a day. 

Nagurao Ji, a senior Sagras employee, advised her when she took the first of three Rang De loans on how she can stock up on items beside readymade garments such as sarees, slippers and other small items. 

Yasmin travels to a wholesale market nearly 30kms away to stock up on such items - the lower costs allow her to earn a sufficient margin on her products. Sagras have also informed her of the need to stock up on a variety of designs in order to stay relevant as a garments seller. 

The clearest evidence of an impact in Yasmin's life has been the construction of a toilet, a goal she had for a long time but which she only managed to achieve recently.

For Deepak, it was a surprising introduction to the extent of patriarchal mindsets in rural India with the harshness of life under poverty only exacerbating the problem. 

"It was shocking to me how even in this century, people still believe in such a concept and to find that other people are willing to put up with it," he told us. 

"There are certain instances in life that touches you. This was one of them. 

"I couldn't talk to her [the little girl] as I was quite surprised. All I could do was shake her hand and wish her good luck. 

"She did not talk to me a lot either but I could see that she is very active. 

"She has a stuffed teddy bear. They raise her more like a boy..." 

With a bittersweet chuckle, Deepak added, "She is almost like a jungle kid." 

We are happy that Yasmin has benefitted from three Rang De loans and improved the standard of living in her family with the added help of mentorship from Sagras. 

  
<br><br>
To make a decision during such a difficult period in her life for the betterment of a child that was not her own makes her a source of inspiration for all of us involved in the fight against poverty and pursuing the quest for women empowerment in rural India. </p>
