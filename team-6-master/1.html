Rajavairam P is no stranger to the sweltering temperatures of Arasadikuppam village in Tamil Nadu and neither to hard work and perseverance. Come what may, her day at her humble grocery store starts at 9 am and lasts until 9 pm. It has been this way since December 2015 when she decided to move on from the arduous task of de-shelling cashews and take her first step towards opening a grocery store. This first step was associating with Rural Education and Action for Liberation (REAL), Rang De’s impact partner in Tamil Nadu, to avail mentoring support and financial assistance. 
<br><br>
In an ideal scenario, 49 is an age when people look forward to receiving pensions and to spending time in the company of children and grandchildren. Instead, Rajavairam and her husband Ponnusamy, 67, looked forward to a loan of Rs 8,000 to be able to contribute to the income of a family that comprises of their three sons, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. 
<br><br>
Their age does not permit them to indulge in labour intensive occupations but it does not deter them from playing a constructive part in running the household. Both not only look after their grocery shop together but also look out for one another, each one taking the other’s place when one has to tend to other matters or visit the hospital. 
<br><br>
Rajavairam’s efforts towards earning a daily profit of at least Rs 150 is also supplemented by selling chaat such as paani puri from afternoon to evenings. These efforts are paying off as she has already repaid nearly half the loan disbursed to her.

<br><br>
Her sons help out in running the family too. Her eldest son used to work for a private company which was unfortunately shut down in the wake of the floods that hit Cuddalore district in late 2015. He has since been working as a manual labourer and faces the challenge of irregular availability of work. 
<br><br>
Her youngest son runs a pickup truck that he bought by availing a loan from a financial institution on monthly installments. Presently, all his earnings are spent on repaying this loan. However, once all the installments are paid, the income from running the pick-up truck will greatly help improve the financial condition of the family. The pickup truck also supports Rajavairam by transporting the goods required for her grocery store. 
<br><br>
As challenging as opening a grocery store and maintaining the necessary provisions to satisfy her customers has been, her beaming smile radiates a sense of satisfaction. She deems herself fit and healthy and remains confident in her belief that if granted another loan, she will be able to expand her business considerably. 
<br><br>
We hope to continue to be a source of support for Rajavairam and her family as they strive to rise above poverty one day at a time.</p>
